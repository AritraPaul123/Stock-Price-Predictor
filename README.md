Stock Price Predictor using Machine Learning

The Stock Price Predictor is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the future closing price of a selected stock. Built using Python and Streamlit, this tool leverages historical stock data and advanced predictive modeling techniques to provide users with insights into the potential future performance of stocks.

Key Features:
Interactive User Interface:

Users can easily select a stock ticker from a predefined list of popular companies.

The application displays historical stock data, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume for the selected stock.

Data Fetching:

The stock data is fetched dynamically from reliable financial data sources.

Users can explore the historical performance of stocks over time.

Stock Price Prediction:

A machine learning model is trained on the historical stock data to predict the next day's closing price.

The model’s predictions are displayed alongside the latest available stock data.

Model Performance:

The application evaluates the model’s performance using common metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

This provides users with an understanding of how accurate the predictions are.

Real-time Prediction:

After selecting a stock ticker, the user gets an immediate prediction for the next day's closing price.

The prediction is displayed alongside relevant performance metrics for transparency.

Technologies Used:
Streamlit: A powerful framework for building interactive data applications quickly.

Pandas & NumPy: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: Utilized for building and evaluating the machine learning models.

Matplotlib: Optional visualization for displaying stock price trends and model performance.

This tool serves as a useful resource for stock traders, investors, and financial analysts who wish to gain insights into potential stock price movements and make data-driven decisions.
